TODO

* Sword Enemy
  - change to use input and map skill/dash to animation/attack? 

* dummy can be killed and respawns in center
  - spawn animation (fade in)

* camera could be an entity with components
  - we could center camera on nekosama for the room victory secuence

* Victory transition (default for now, then a nice one)
  - custom victory screen, then credits, then restart the game

* Victory cinematic (on nekosama room, some dialogue, etc)
  - on enter room, remove hud (indicates we are not in a fight room), and remove weapon or disable weapon
  - on near nekosama, dialogue
  - on dialogue complete, show victory

* change kunai and sword to attack1 and attack2 in animator

* separate attack direction from movement direction, normally the same so frog can attack in other directions.

* hold to dash and release to stop, and have max distance

* Dash
  - ignore hits while dashing
  - ignore enemy collision while dashing (move through enemies)
  - bug: move through walls

* On hit become invulnerable

* Bugs
  - sword attack direction when moving up/down is always to the right.

* Others
  - hud show coins
