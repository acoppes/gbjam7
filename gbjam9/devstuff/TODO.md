TODO

* Restart game in main menu on player dead
* victory on nekosama pickup

* Death animations - nekonin (instead of destroying the object)

* User interface (mainly the neko life)

* camera could be an entity with components
  - we could center camera on nekosama for the room victory secuence

* Victory transition (default for now, then a nice one)
* Victory cinematic (on nekosama room, some dialogue, etc)

* Death animations - enemies

* Sword Enemy

* enemy deaths + blood effect

* change kunai and sword to attack1 and attack2 in animator

* separate attack direction from movement direction, normally the same so frog can attack in other directions.

* hold to dash and release to stop, and have max distance

* Dash
  - ignore hits while dashing
  - ignore enemy collision while dashing (move through enemies)
  - bug: move through walls

* On hit become invulnerable
