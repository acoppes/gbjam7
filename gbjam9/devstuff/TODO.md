BUGS

* colliders door before open
* collider stones and statues are blocking some attacks or the problem might be the kunai.
  - we might want to separate walking colliders from hit colliders
* collider sword when attacking enemies above

TODO

* Dialogue at start saying something like "I have to pick a weapon for my journey" or a sign for that.
* Make signs say something or remove them (people try to touch them all the time), in case we add text
  - One for the dummy saying it is a training area
  - One for the start, saying pick a weapon 
  - One for spikes the first time you encounter them (maybe in main room)
  - One for the ending of the game? (not sure what to say there since there is a cinematic)

* Enemies coinst on killed

* Room changes music on enemies killed

* Music fade out/in

* Samurainu
  - wander logic (just pick random position to walk)

* dummy can be killed and respawns in center
  - spawn animation (fade in)

* camera could be an entity with components
  - we could center camera on nekosama for the room victory secuence

* change kunai and sword to attack1 and attack2 in animator
