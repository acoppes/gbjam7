* Improve song map for thriller, distribute notes in more segments (not sure how to get notes from midi visual)
* Start the level with a preparation phase or something
* Select song menu (would love to have some kind of song cover but I am no pixelartist)
* Numbers to change palettes
* Zombies move if you fail notes
  - sfx for failure? (too much? could be low volume)
* Zombies dance moves with notes
* Character dance moves with notes
* Game over when zombies near
  - Game Over screen
* Victory if music completed
  - don't move the scroll to the start if music completed
  - go to splash screen after victory
